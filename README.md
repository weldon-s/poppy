# Poppy
Poppy is a programming language I am creating. The ultimate goal is to use it to write various software for the Raspberry Pi, so it compiles to be run in the ARM64 execution state of ARM ISAs.

Language specification is largely modelled after that for ISO C. As well, Poppy's syntax is rather C-like.
